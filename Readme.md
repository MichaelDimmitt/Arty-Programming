<b>Programming let me write the novel that I could never build.</b>
<br>with more tools than solely a pen,
<br>for truly, novelists have a strength; they find voice with 

I was not one of those gifted few.
<br>finally Tools and customization allowed my words to paper; 
<br>my Drawings to come alive. sting chars to affect things; people;

some effect society with action. They run into the world and grab things.
<br>Fit into systems others create. And in the absence... start societies that others join.

Writers talk of worlds that do not exist. that cannot exist. So that they may be written down.
<br>Form rule .. containers, so that the idea can germinate
<br>Get others to join . And sign their contract. 
<br>They memorize verbal to remember and recite. or write on paper to remember and recite.

and purpose.

All the recipees to be able to write a lot. 
I can program small(3 lines of code useful program) or I can program big (thousand lines of code seperately super useful program)

For your ideas to flow THE ENVIRONMENT must be customizable.
<br>In the absence of customization we survive. 

In abstract abject stories dreaming of the world that was.
<br>Awaiting the release of version "new" that opens the door.

Dreading when the new update breaks the software. 
<br>And hoping we can find a pirated way back. 
<br>Because old software never truly dies.

The Apple Store can delete the app from your phone but you can always email the founder.

"Open Source", It made my life so much easier.
<br>cuts the the cloak of suspicion and non answer toward the skill worthiness of others.
<br>thereby learning the skillworthiness of yourself.
